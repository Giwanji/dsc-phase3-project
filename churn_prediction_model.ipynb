    "The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every online business. Besides the direct loss of revenue that results from a customer abandoning the business, the costs of initially acquiring that customer may not have already been covered by the customer’s spending to date. (In other words, acquiring that customer may have actually been a losing investment.) Furthermore, it is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer"

Predicting churn can help the Telecom company, so it can effectively focus a customer retention marketing program (e.g. a special offer) to the subset of clients which are most likely to change their carrier. Therefore, the “churn” column is chosen as target and the following predictive analysis is a supervised classification problem."
